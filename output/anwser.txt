Flow cytometry is a powerful technique used in the analysis and quantification of microplastics, which are small plastic particles that pose a significant threat to the environment and human health. In the context of the special issue on microplastics and analytical methods, flow cytometry is one of the techniques discussed for the identification and quantification of microplastics.

Flow cytometry is a widely used method in various fields, including biology, medicine, and environmental science. It involves the use of a flow cytometer, which is an instrument that combines lasers, optics, and fluidics to measure and analyze the properties of individual particles suspended in a fluid. This technique allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple parameters, such as size, shape, and fluorescence intensity, providing detailed information about the analyzed particles.

In the case of microplastics, flow cytometry offers several advantages over other techniques. Firstly, it enables high-throughput analysis, allowing for the rapid and efficient screening of large sample volumes. This is particularly important when dealing with environmental samples, where large amounts of water or sediment need to be processed. Additionally, flow cytometry can provide information on the size distribution of microplastics, which is crucial for understanding their environmental fate and impacts.

The process of flow cytometry begins with the preparation of the sample. In the case of microplastics, this typically involves filtering the sample to separate the particles from the surrounding matrix. The filtered sample is then stained with fluorescent dyes that bind specifically to microplastics, allowing them to be easily distinguished from other particles present in the sample. The stained sample is then introduced into the flow cytometer, where it passes through a narrow flow cell. As the particles flow through the flow cell, they are illuminated by lasers, causing them to emit fluorescence. The emitted fluorescence is collected by detectors, and the resulting signals are processed and analyzed by the instrument's software.

One of the key advantages of flow cytometry is its ability to discriminate microplastics from other particles based on their fluorescence properties. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex environmental samples, where microplastics may be present alongside naturally occurring particles, such as algae or sediment. By using specific fluorescent dyes, flow cytometry can selectively target microplastics and provide accurate and reliable results.

However, it is important to note that flow cytometry is not without limitations. One of the main challenges is the identification and discrimination of microplastics from other particles that may exhibit similar fluorescence properties. This requires the use of appropriate controls and reference materials to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, flow cytometry is a relatively expensive technique, requiring specialized instrumentation and expertise. The cost of the instrument, reagents, and maintenance can be a limiting factor for many laboratories.

Despite these limitations, flow cytometry has been successfully applied in the analysis of microplastics in various environmental samples, including water, sediment, and biota. Its ability to provide high-throughput analysis and detailed characterization of microplastics makes it a valuable tool in the field of microplastic research. Furthermore, the emerging field of nanoplastic analysis, which focuses on the detection and quantification of even smaller plastic particles, can also benefit from the use of flow cytometry.

In conclusion, flow cytometry is a powerful and versatile technique for the analysis of microplastics. Its ability to provide high-throughput analysis, detailed characterization, and discrimination of microplastics from other particles makes it a valuable tool in the field of microplastic research. However, it is important to consider the limitations and costs associated with this technique. With the ongoing efforts to standardize operational protocols for microplastic analysis, flow cytometry is expected to play an increasingly important role in the assessment of microplastic pollution and the development of effective mitigation strategies.
